	<h2 class="sect1title"><a name="iverilog">2. Icarus Verilog</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>

        <p> Icarus Verilog is a free Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It
compiles source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format. It
also generates netlists for the synthesis part. It's by far the best free tool
and many people work on that making it more and more complete day by day.
Well, because I use Linux (which doesn't mean anything
for the concept of the guide), I'll show you everything with commands for such OS's.
For Windows and MacOS users the way of installation is different.
        </p>

	<h3 class="sect2title"><a name="install">2.1. Installation</a></h3>

        <p> Open a terminal and type (or copy-paste) the below commands.<br />
Firstly, add a new ppa:

<pre class="screen">
 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-electronics/ppa
</pre>

Then, update the local repository cache:

<pre class="screen">
 $ sudo apt-get update
</pre>

Finally, install (update) the Icarus Verilog package

<pre class="screen">
 $ sudo apt-get install iverilog
</pre>
        </p>

	<h3 class="sect2title"><a name="usage">2.2. Usage</a></h3>


        <p> Let's say you have the source files one.v and two.v to compile. A
quick way to compile them is just by typing:
<pre class="screen">
 $ iverilog one.v two.v
</pre>

In that way, a.out is created and that's our binary:
<pre class="screen">
 $ ls
 $ a.out one.v two.v
</pre>

Now we can execute a.out with <b>vvp</b> command:
<pre class="screen">
 $ vvp a.out
</pre>


If you want to specify another name for the binary, you can use the <b>-o</b> option just like in <b>gcc</b>:
<pre class="screen">
 $ iverilog 足o my_out.out one.v two.v
 $ ls
 $ one.v two.v my_out.v
</pre>

Well, all these are ok, but if you want to write on big, or complex verilog code, you should also use
during the compilation the <b>-Wall</b> option:
<pre class="screen">
 $ iverilog 足Wall 足o my_out.out one.v two.v
</pre>
足<b>Wall</b> option works in the same logic as in gcc. It enables more warnings during the compilation,
that can help you find that little thing that destroys the functionality of your hardware. And yes,
warnings in our case can affect the functionality of our design more often than programming in C.
So <b>-Wall</b> is a must. You should also consider on <b>-Winfloop</b>. You can imagine its usage.
Well, that's all from me about Icarus Verilog. If you want to learn more about it, you should visit it's
<a href=http://iverilog.icarus.com/>official website</a> and for further How To's and support its <a href=http://iverilog.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page>official wiki</a>.
I also recommend you to subscribe to the <a href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/iverilog-devel>mailing list</a>.
