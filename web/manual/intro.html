	<h2 class="sect1title"><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>

        <p> Here is a guide for those who want to develop and test hardware on
Linux OS. The positives of working/developing on Linux is that you don't have
to work on Windows and thus in most cases you can have everything for free. The
most important thing is that you have everything open source.  Noone restricts
you from using something that already exists, in the way you want. That's the
main reason I prefer solutions in Linux like that than examples like ModelSim.
They are ok, but they restict me.  </p> <p> This guide isn't supposed to
include every little detail of either Icarus Verilog or GTKWave, but the things
you have to do to use some extra functionality that probably you haven't in
mind to use or you couldn't know how to do it because of lack of support on the
Internet. The main goal of this guide is to show you how to view in GTKWave the
values of the signals of your program in a more human way. In a way that will
help you a lot with debugging. In a way such the image below: </p>


	<h3 class="sect2title"><a name="audience">1.1. Audience</a></h3>

        <p>This document has been written as a guide, not as a full reference.
Probably, it is better for those who start using these tools. The only
prerequisitive in order to achieve the goals of that document is that the
readers have a good level of programming in order to create their own
parser/translator.

	<h3 class="sect2title"><a name="platform">1.2. Platform and Interpreter</a></h3>

        <p>The code is written in Python3 and is tested with python3 interpreter on a
        Linux machine. Whatever is your platform, you should get the same results with
        the python3 interpreter from the <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>python website</a>.
        </p>

        <p>As for the verilog code and other tools used (shell script), these are
        only tested on a Linux environment and never attempted on any other platform.
        I do not intent to make a guide for Windows or MacOS user in the near future.
        </p>


	<h3 class="sect2title"><a name="emailpolicy">1.3. Email Policy</a></h3>

	<p>I'm generally available to help out with <a name="indexId434909-18"></a>email questions so feel free to write in, but I can't guarantee a
	response.  I lead a pretty busy life and there are times when I just
	can't answer a question you have.  When that's the case, I usually just
	delete the message.  It's nothing personal; I just won't ever have the
	time to give the detailed answer you require.</p>

	<p>As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
	respond.  If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
	sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
	error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
	troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.  For more
	pointers, read ESR's document, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_blank">How To Ask
	Questions The Smart Way</a>.</p>

	<p>If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
	answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
	information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
	out.</p>
